# findmyseries.xyz
My first REALLY big personal project. </br> </br>
findmyseries.xyz is a tv show/movie recommendation engine running on the power of machine learning and neural networks (coming soon!).
*The mission of this project is to build an application through which a user can find a series/a movie that he/she will enjoy a lot. The main goals are to reduce searching time for a new series that gets the user hooked and make the search platform-independent (opposed to Netflix&Co).* </br></br>

This project is first of all a learning project. The main learnings will be achieved in the backend/machine learning part. The frontend is kept simple on purpose. In the background there is an automated CI/CD pipeline, Terraform and Google Cloud are used for the deployments.
