# findmeaseries.com
My first big personal project. </br> </br>
findmeaseries.com will be a series/tv show recommendation engine running on the power of machine learning and neural networks.
*The mission of this project is to build an application through which a user can find a series that he/she will enjoy a lot. The main goals are to reduce searching time for a new series that gets the user hooked and make the search platform-independent (opposed to Netflix&Co).* </br></br>
In the best case would be to build a profitable business out of the recommendation engine, let's see where we get with this ;)
